# diverse_strings
A string is called happy(diverse) if it does not have any of the strings 'aaa', 'bbb' or 'ccc' as a substring. 

Given three integers a, b and c, return any string s, which satisfies following conditions:

s is happy and longest possible.
s contains at most a occurrences of the letter 'a', at most b occurrences of the letter 'b' and at most c occurrences of the letter 'c'.
s will only contain 'a', 'b' and 'c' letters.
If there is no such string s return the empty string "".
